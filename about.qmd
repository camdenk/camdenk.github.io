I am a self-taught data scientist from Las Vegas, NV. I received my BS studying Physics from James Madison University in 2021. My passion for sports led me to learn how to code while at school and eventually make [mlbplotR](https://camdenk.github.io/mlbplotR/) and contribute to [baseballr](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) after I graduated. R is my preferred language for analysis, but starting using Python first so I have lots of experience with both.

I have previously worked as an analytics fellow for the [Baltimore Orioles](https://www.mlb.com/orioles), a data analyst for [Tread Athletics](treadathletics.com), and as the Director of Analytics for the [JMU Baseball Team](https://jmusports.com/sports/baseball).
