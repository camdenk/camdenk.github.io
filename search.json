    "text": "I am a self-taught data scientist from Las Vegas, NV. I received my BS studying Physics from James Madison University in 2021. My passion for sports led me to learn how to code while at school and eventually make mlbplotR and contribute to baseballr after I graduated. R is my preferred language for analysis, but starting using Python first so I have lots of experience with both.\nI have previously worked as an analytics fellow for the Baltimore Orioles, a data analyst for Tread Athletics, and as the Director of Analytics for the JMU Baseball Team."
